        René Descartes invented analytical geometry and introduced skepticism as an essential part of the scientific method. He is regarded as one of the greatest philosophers in history.
    His analytical geometry was a tremendous conceptual breakthrough, 
    linking the previously separate fields of geometry and algebra. 
    Descartes showed that he could solve previously unsolvable problems
    in geometry by converting them into simpler problems in algebra. 
    He represented the horizontal direction as x and the vertical direction as y.
    This concept is now indispensable in mathematics and other sciences.

    <h2>Discussion of the Method</h2>

    In Discussion of the Method Descartes shared his framework for doing science.

One of his main lines of thought was skepticism – that everything should be doubted until it could be proved.

His four main ideas for scientific progress were:
        <ol>
            <li>Never accept anything as true until all reasons for doubt can be ruled out.</li>
            <li>Divide problems into as many parts as possible and necessary to provide an adequate solution.</li>
            <li>Thoughts should be ordered, starting with the simplest and easiest to know, ascending little by little, and, step by step, to more complex knowledge.</li>
            <li>Make enumerations so complete, and reviews so general, that nothing is omitted.</li>
        </ol>

It is ironic that Descartes’ own method might lead us to doubt that a dream 18 years earlier could have been the true source of his ideas!
